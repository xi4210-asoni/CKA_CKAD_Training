kubectl describe secrets prometheus-prometheus-operator-kube-p-prometheus

For creating service monitor crds
It needs to point to the service we have exposed 
For the service monitor to actually -  give lables of the service used + port name


 k port-forward svc/prometheus-operator-grafana 8082:80
 k port-forward svc/prometheus-operator-kube-p-prometheus 9092:9090
